.SH NAME
midit \- play Standard MIDI Files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B midit
\-p client:port[,...] midifile [...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B midit
is a command-line utility that plays the specified MIDI file(s) to one
or more ALSA sequencer ports. It is derived from
.B aplaymidi(1)
and is capable of pausing, accelerating and slowing down tempo, seeking
backwards and forwards, displaying information such as position in track
in ticks or in 'minutes:seconds' format. It can also display the midi events
being read.

name. A port is specified by its number; for port 0 of a client, the
":0" part of the port specification can be omitted.
